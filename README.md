## Project Name:
**Food Delivery System - Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm**

## Project Motivation:
The motivation behind this project is to implement an optimized food delivery system, where the shortest path to deliver food from a central location (like a pizza shop) to various customers is calculated efficiently. By using Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm, the system aims to minimize delivery time, improving customer satisfaction and reducing operational costs for delivery drivers.

## Project Description:
The **Food Delivery System** aims to simulate the process of delivering food to customers in a city or locality by calculating the shortest paths from a central location (the pizza shop) to multiple delivery points (customers). This is achieved using **Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm** which helps in finding the least-cost path (shortest distance) from the source node to all other nodes in the graph. In this system:
- Each customerâ€™s location is represented as a node in a graph.
- Roads between locations are represented by weighted edges in the graph.
- The program calculates the minimum distance from the pizza shop (node 0) to all other customers' locations using the adjacency matrix to represent the road network.

The implementation contains:
- A constructor to initialize the system with a specified number of nodes (customers).
- The `dijkstra_algorithm()` function that performs the main pathfinding algorithm.
- Helper methods like `getNodeWithMinimumDistance()` to identify the next node to evaluate and `calculateNeighbours()` to update distances for neighboring nodes.

By implementing this system, the shortest routes can be selected for faster and more efficient deliveries.

## Tech Stack Used:
- **Java**: The core programming language for implementing the system.
- **Data Structures**:
  - **HashSet**: Used to manage the nodes (customers) that are settled or unsettled.
  - **Adjacency Matrix**: Used to store the road network and represent edges (distances between nodes).
- **Algorithm**:
  - **Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm**: The primary algorithm used to calculate the minimum delivery path.

## Future Scope:
- **Dynamic Road Network**: Incorporate dynamic updates for road conditions (e.g., traffic or road closures) in real-time to adapt delivery routes.
- **User Interface**: Build a graphical interface or web-based platform to visualize the delivery system and allow users to input their locations, view paths, and track deliveries.
- **Multiple Sources and Destinations**: Extend the system to handle multiple starting points (e.g., multiple restaurants) and multiple delivery destinations at once.
- **Optimization with Machine Learning**: Introduce machine learning models to predict traffic patterns and optimize delivery routes based on historical data.
- **Mobile Application**: Develop a mobile app for delivery drivers to receive optimized routes in real time, with integration into a GPS system for better navigation.

With these improvements, the system could evolve into a fully functional real-world food delivery solution that accounts for real-time traffic conditions, varied start points, and better user experience.
